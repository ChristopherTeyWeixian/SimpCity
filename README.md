Methodology Analysis 

 

1) The 4 models with their basic understanding of what they are 

 

Spiral 

What is this Model 

Spiral model is a systems development lifecycle (SDLC) method used for risk management that combines the iterative development process model with elements of the Waterfall model. The model can be broken down into four phases, being requirements, analysis, development and review. These four phases are passed through in iterations, which are essentially spirals in the model. Scrum can be implemented alongside the model, helping to increase the efficiency in development process, with each sprint plan being associated with a development cycle. 

 

Does it fit towards our project 

Somewhat, this SDLC model is mainly used for large projects, but is also suitable for game development. This model allows for risk assessment at the start of the project after determining all the requirements needed, allowing the team to manage risks better throughout. 

Starting the development using the core features can allow the team to get a prototype quickly and play test to see what is needed/next. 

Should there be anything missing or unresolved, said tasks can be added to the next spiral cycle for further development. 

In the worst case, development can be halted, stopping the spiral. 

 

 

Waterfall 

What is this Model 

The waterfall model is used in a system development life cycle (SDLC) method to create a product or prototype in a strict linear path from stage to stage. It is called a waterfall model as the process flow in a linear path and is not advised to return to previous stages.  This model divides the work into multiple stages with the output of the current stage being served as the input for the next stage.  

 

Does it fit towards our project 

With our project having a short deadline, it is ideal to use the waterfall model as it works well for projects with short deadline. 

With the requirements of our project stated very clearly, it can be planned into stages on when to meet them with the use of the waterfall model. This will benefit the project as it will be easy to manage as each stage will have specific outcome that need to be reviewed.  

In addition, it will allow the process and outcome of each phase to be documented well which will be beneficial for our projects. 

 

 

Incremental 

What is this Model 

The incremental model is a process of software development in which requirements are divided into several independent modules of the software development cycle. In this model, each module goes through the requirements, design, implementation and testing phases. Each subsequent version of the module adds functionality to the previous version. This process continues until all requirements for the product are met. 

 

Does it fit towards our project 

Yes, because after each increment, for any newly added features, our team can look through the code and test out the game to see if there are any issues with the newly added features. 

The team that is testing the program, can give their feedback on it and give their opinion on how to improve the program or find any issues with it. 

This model can help us check if any of the developed features break during the program. If any issues were to occur, we can quickly rectify the issue. Also, if it is a major error that cause the whole program to fail, we can revert back to the previous build since there is not much progress with each increment. 

 

 

Extreme Programming 

What is this Model 

Extreme Programming (XP) is a methodology that uses the Agile Concept and aims to produce higher quality software and quality of life for the development team. XP is mostly used for research projects or new technology projects, due to XP’s specificity when it comes to its software engineering practices, there are some situations where it is not necessary to fully practice XP. XP follows 5 values and 5 principles, the values are communication, simplicity, feedback, courage and respect, the principles are rapid feedback, assume simplicity, incremental changes, embraces changes and quality of work. 

 

XP also has a core flow within the methodology, which is Pair Programming, as it has 2 developers working on a single device. One of them would work as a Driver and the other as an Observer, the Driver would be the one coding and Observer would be checking for coding mistake or any other methods that could improve the code. The roles could be switched at any time making use of each other’s strong point while reducing the amount of mistake and increasing the quality of work. 

 

Does it fit towards our project 

XP is mainly used for small projects that consist of a small team.  

XP uses the Agile Concept thus it is suitable for a game development such as our project. 

The Values and Principles practice in XP is suitable for our small team as it will be easier to practice with a small amount of people rather than a huge team. 

 

 

 

 

2) Pros and Cons of the 4 models 

Spiral 

Pros:  

Get Prototype quickly especially for a game 

Flexible and allow quick changes 

Start with core features 

Risk management 

Cons: 

Last few cycles do not allow for big changes 

More documentation with intermediate phases 

Risk of not meeting schedule (With never-ending spiral) 

 

Waterfall 

Pros:  

It has well-defined stages 

Works well for small-scale projects with all of the requirements stated  

Process and output of each phase are documented. 

Ideal for short projects 


Cons: 

Not advised to return to previous stages. 

As testing is done at a later phase, challenges and risks are not identified and prevented early. 

It is difficult to measure progress within stages of the project. 

High risk and uncertainty. 

No working product/prototype until later part of the life cycle. 

It does not allow much room for reflection or revision.   
 

Incremental 

Pros: 

It is flexible and less expensive to change requirements and scope. 

This model is less costly compared to others. 

Easy to spot errors 

Easy to change if there are any errors. 

The users can respond to each build quickly and state their opinion. 

 

Cons 

Needs good planning and design. 

Needs a clear and complete definition of the whole system before it can be broken down and built incrementally. 



Extreme Programming 

Pros 

No unnecessary programming works 

Stable software through continuous testing 

Error avoidance through pair programming 

No overtime, teams work at their own pacing 

Changes can be made at short notice 

Code is clear and comprehensible at all times 

Close contact with customer 

 

Cons 

Additional work 

Customer must participate in the process 

Relatively large time investment 

Relatively high costs 

Requires version management 

Requires self-discipline to practice 

 

Pair Programming 

Pros/Cons 

Two heads better than one 

More efficient 

Fewer coding mistakes 

Effective way to share knowledge 

Develops the pair interpersonal skills 

 
 

3)Chosen Methodology 

Incremental Model 


3a) The Reasons 

The reason for incremental is because, as a team we feel that Incremental is far more flexible and manageable than the other Methodology. For example, Incremental allows our team members to check for mistakes at an early stage in development and it also allow the other team-members to know of the progress of the project much faster. If a situation were to happen, where the developer messed up badly, in one of the increments, not much progress would be lost since increments are usually done in short burst. If we were to use this Incremental Methodology, risk management would definitely be better and it would definitely benefit our team more, since some of our team-members is familiar with this Methodology and had already have experienced using it in a project. 

The disadvantages of using Spiral Model far outweigh the advantages, there are long-term consequences if the model is not strictly followed. 


While the first few cycles of using Spiral Model can allow the team to get a working prototype quickly, starting with the core features, if the team is not careful with the planning or should there be any unexpected obstacles, making big changes will be quite difficult during the last few cycles as the entire product/prototype is very deep into development. 

Additionally, with each cycle in spiral model, there are more iterations of each of the 4 phases, which means that there will be more documentation to be done with each intermediate phases. While documentation can be great to record each detail of the project, it can be cumbersome to document each cycle, each phase as the number of cycles start to add up. 

One of the reasons for not using the waterfall model is that it holds a lot of risks such as being advised not to return to previous stages of work once they had been completed. For example, discovering problems in the testing stage and trying to fix it will be difficult as the product is deep in into the development stages. 

In addition, waterfall method does not allow for much reflection or revision which disable us to improve on the quality of the past stages. This may allow us to save time on the project but it will be detrimental in the long run, as quality will be compromised as we did not come together to discuss on how to improve on the project, based on feedbacks given to one another. 

Besides that, it will be difficult to gauge on the progress within the stages of the project as progress is only being gauged once the work is completed. 

The reason for not using extreme programming as our methodology is simply because the project flow is complex, and we are not familiar with how it will really work out as compared to the incremental methodology. Another point is that Pair Programming is an essential flow in the methodology, and it requires 2 developers to be able to work and communicate well with one another, the current team now is not really familiar with one another and none of us has experience in Pair Programming and is more individuality thus we think it would be a detriment than an improvement.
